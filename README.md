# Rust-Actix-Todo-Api

This is a rest api created using the Actix Web Framework. This is a learning project and code will change as I learn RUST.

### RUN

In order to run the project run:
`Cargo watch -x 'run'`

Cargo watch is equivalent of Nodemon in Javascript/Typescript and seems to work fine for most cases 

### DOCS

includes api collection to run all possible endpoints using the Thunder client VsCode extension
